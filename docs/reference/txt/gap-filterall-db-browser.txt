"gap-filterall-db-browser"
 
Animated calls of plug-in filters:

  Start from Menu:
     <Image>/Filters/Filter all Layers   
     <Image>/Script-Fu/Animators/Sel To AnimImage
     
 
  First of all, you need a multilayered Image.
  You can use "<Image>/Video/Frames to Image"
  to create one from a series of frames,
  or duplicate the backround layer of a single layered image
  (Press Ctrl-C within the layers dialog window N-times)

  Then call "Filter all Layers" from wihin the multilayer image.
  You'll get a window similar to the PDB-Browser, that shows
  all available plug-ins in a listbox (and informations about
  the selected plug-in on the right side).


  Select one of the listed plug-ins, then select acceleration characteristic
  and press the Apply button to continue with the next dialog step.

  Note: The listbox does not show the full PDB, but
        only those plug-ins that are capable to run under control
	of the "Filter all Layers" plug-in.
  
        some of them are restricted for apply with a fixed setting
        on all handled layers. for Those plug-ins the
        Acceleration Characteristic spnbutton widget is disabled.
        The other plug-ins are capable to be applied
        with varying values and enable the spinbutton.

  
  "Acceleration Characteristic"
      can be set with a spinbutton where you can enter a value.
      A graph next to the spinbutton shows the selected characteristic.
      The acceleration characteristic can also be changed by
      clicking on th graph and dragging vertically with the mouse.

      A straight line from left bottom to right top corner of the graph
      is drawn for value 1 that represents constant speed.
      (This is the same behavior as the "Apply Varying" button
      worked in older GIMP-GAP releases 2.6 and earlier)
      Positive values greater than 1 result in an accelerated
      change of the settings, negative values result in decelerated
      change of the settings.

      With Acceleration Characteristic value other than 0
      the selected plug-in is called 2 times in interactive mode,
      1. for the backround layer
      2. for the top layer.
      This defines the settings at begin and at end.
      
      For all further layers, the plug-in will work non-interactive
      with the iterated inbetween values that were internally stored in memory
      as settings for begin and end, respecting the acceleration characteristic.
      (constant speed, acceleration or deceleration) 
      
      
      
      Note:
            It is possible to iterate values of the type PARAM_DRAWABLE,
            (such as the BumpMap in plug_in_bump_map:
            You may use a layerstack-animated Image as animated Bump-map)
            This will only work, if from and to values are layers within the same image.
            The iteration is done on the layerstackindex in that case.
            and the inbetween values for the non-interactive filtercalls
            will be the layers between the from and to layerstackindex.
            (an animation sequence as the user might expect)             

      
      
      With Acceleration Characteristic value 0 varying feature
      is turned off, and the graph is rendered as empty rectangle.
      In this case selected plug-in is called only once in interactive mode,
      For all further layers, the plug-in will work non-interactive
      using the last stored values.
      (This is the same behavior as the "Apply Constant" button
      worked in older GIMP-GAP releases 2.6 and earlier)
      
      


  The script sel-to-anim-img.scm simplifies the creation of animated
  images. Invoke the script from:

             "<Image>/Script-Fu/Animators/Sel To AnimImage"
             
  The script creates a new image with n copies of the current selection.
  Then it invokes the animated call of plug-in filters (optional)
  on the generated new image.

  Notes:
    - when new plug-ins are installed, they are
      not automatically capable to be applying with varying values,
      unless the plug-in implements an "_Iterator" procedure,
      (see docs/howto/HOWTO-write-animated-plug-ins.txt)
      or registers in the GIMP_GAP configuration file
      
        lastval_descriptions.txt 
      
      located in the gimp configuration directory
      in your $HOME (uniX) or Documents and Settings (WindowsXP)

      Here is an example entry for the wideangle 3rd party plug-in:      


      # --------------------- 
      "plug_in_wideangle" #- added manually 
      STRUCT_BEGIN;0;48;1;
        gdouble;0;8;1;centre_x
        gdouble;8;8;1;centre_y
        gdouble;16;8;1;square_a
        gdouble;24;8;1;quad_a
        gdouble;32;8;1;scale_a
        gdouble;40;8;1;brighten
      STRUCT_END;0;4;1;



    - Some plug-ins may not work correct or crash when called
      in NON_INTERACTIVE mode. (see TESTPROT_iter_ALT)

    - Some plug-ins have options to create new layers or images.
      This does not work when they are invoked
      under control of the "Filter all Layers" plug-in.
      You should turn such options off in that case.
        
    - Some pug-in's in your PDB can have earlier or later versions
      If their interfaces were changed and does not match with the
      interface version of the iterator procedure
      you get the message:(in the shell window)
        
          ERROR: xxxx_Iterator stored Data missmatch in size N != M
               
      when using the "Apply Varying" button.
      In that case you can try to generate the needed _Iterator procedure
      for your plug-ins current interface by yourself.
