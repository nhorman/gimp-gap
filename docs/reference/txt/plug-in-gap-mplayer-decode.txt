MPLayer based extract

    Start from Menu:
	<Image>/Video/Split Video to Frames/MPLayer based extract
        <Toolbox>/Xtns/Split Video to Frames/MPLayer based extract

    Extract frames and/or audio from a videofile.    
    This feature is only available on UNIX systems and is 
    a frontend for the mediaplayer program mplayer.

    For that feature GIMP-GAP must be configured and compiled 
    with the configure option:
        --enable-unix-frontends
	  
    
    Further it is required that mplayer is installed on your system
    at run time.
    (GIMP_GAP was tested with mplayer-1.0pre5).
    
    
    MPlayer does support many videofileformats amd codecs and offers
    access to more vidoefiles than the other GIMP-GAP video extract
    features. But it does not provide frame exact positioning.
       

  Input Video:
    Here you can enter the name of an input videofile.
    The "..." button opens a filebrowser popup dialog
    where you can select a filename.
    
  Start Time:
    Start time of the selected range in format HH:MM:SS.

    Note:
    MPlayer always extracts the 1.st frame of the video too
    regardless if you start at 00:00:00 or not.
    
  Frames:
    Number of frames to extract. If the video has less frames than
    specified here, extract will stop at the last available frame.
    
  Videotrack:
    Here you can select the number of the input videotrack.
    Most videos have just one videotrack.
    Some DVD videos have multiple angle view where the different
    angles are represented by 2 or more videotracks.
    Use a videotrack value 0 to ignore videoframes.
    
  Audiotrack:
    Here you can select the number of the input audiotrack.
    Most videos have just one audiotrack.
    Some DVD videos have multiple language support where the different
    languages are represented by 2 or more audiotracks.
    Use a audiotrack value 0 to ignore audiotracks.
  
  Output Audio:
    Filename for the extracted audio wave file to write.
    (ignored if audiotrack is 0, or if the input video
    has no audiopart)

  Framenames:
    Basenamepart for the extracted frames to write.
    The 6-digit numberpart and the extension (.png, .jpeg .xcf)
    are added for each extracted frame.
  
  Format:
    Imagefileformat for the extracted frames.
      JPEG
      PNG
      XCF
      
    Note: XCF fileformat is not directly supported by mplayer.
          In this case the ectracted frames are created in PNG
	  imagefileformat and converted to the GIMP's native 
	  XCF fileformat automatically.
	  You should use Png Compression 0 in that case
	  for faster opration.
  
  Png Compression:
    Compression for extracted PNG frames
    where 0 is uncompressed (fastest)
    and 9 is best compression.
    Png Compression is ignored if format JPEG is used.
    
  Jpeg Quality:
    Quality of the frames where 100 is best quality (but largest filesize)
  Jpeg Optimize:
    Optimization factor [0-100]
  Jpeg Smooth:
    Smooth factor [0-100]
  Jpeg Progressive:
    Specify standard or progressive JPEG.
  Jpeg Baseline:
    Specify use of baseline or not.

    The Jpeg options are ignored if another format than JPEG
    is selected.
    
  Silent:
    ON: tell mplayer to ignore video audio when no track
        is selcted.
    OFF: mplayer plays unselected video /audio (where track is 0)
        on standard devices.
	E.g. if audiotrack is 0, you will hear the audio track,
	     if videotrack is 0, the corresponding frames will
	     be visible at audioextract.

  Open:
    Open the 1.st extracted frame when extracting is done.
    
  Asynchron:
    ON: Run mplayer as asynchron process and try to show
        progress on base of the already extracted frames.
    OFF: call mplayer as synchron process.
        (progress for the extracting step is not possible in that case)
