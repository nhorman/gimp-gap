Project gap "GIMP Animation Package"   10. Oct. 2011  (pre)release 2.6.1

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The GIMP is a great program for creating and manipulating
pixelbased images of many types. 
The plug-in concept and the procedural database
allows programmers to extend the GIMP's functions in many ways.

In the GIMP there are some plug-in's supporting animation features,
based on layers where each layer of the image is considered as one frame
of the animation.
GIMP-GAP is a collection of plug-ins that extends the 
GIMP's animation capabilities
by supporting the creation of more complex animations.

Idea:
	With the help of the GIMP-GAP plug-in collection
	GIMP can operate on a series of images as if they were
	a single one.
	Each frame of an animation can have multiple layers.
	The user can step from frame to frame by pressing an accelerator key
	or can do image manipulations that are propagated automatically
	to a selected range of frames.

	Layeranimated images can be combined with frames (multiple images)
	as you can see in the "Move Path" plug-in
        or converted to frames and vice-versa. 

	
General:
	An animation consists of a series of images of the same size & type
	(frames).
	The concept of GIMP-GAP is to store each frame separate on disk, using a filename
	convention that includes the frame number and extension.

	Example: film_000001.xcf, 
	         film_000002.xcf
	         ..
	         film_000012.xcf
	
	GIMP's xcf fileformat should be used to store the frames,
	so that each frame can have more layers.

	Sound is not supported in this concept, but will be handled
	as sperate audiofiles at encoding time or in the playback module.
	The playback framerate and other common information about the animation
	are stored in an extra videoinfo textfile
	         film_vin.gap
	
	This requires a lot of diskspace but offers much more flexibility
	while working on the animation.

	To save diskspace you may optional use gziped xcf frames
	(takes extra time to un/compress) by using the extension .xcfgz
	(gzip has to be installed on your system to do that)
	If you can accept lossy compression you may also use 
	the xjt fileformat to store your frames on jpeg based compression.
	The curent implementation of the xjt fileformat
	is restricted to UNIX operating systems.

Input from videofile:
	GIMP-GAP has features to access both audio and frames in
	already encoded videofiles.
	
	On way to deal with such videofiles is to extract
	the frames. Each frame can be stored as numbered frame
	image on disk in that case. GIMP-GAP has a built in
	video extracting plug-in (based on ffmpeg and libmeg3).
	
	## refere to (plug-in-gap-extract-video.txt) ##
	
	On UNIX platforms GIMP-GAP also provides frontends
	for the videoplayers 
	- mplayer
	- xanim
	those players are capable to extract frames from
	common videofile formats (avi, mpeg, quicktime, ....) .
	Please note that xanim is old unmaintained software.
	The frontend for xanim is still there and may even work if
	you still have xanim exporting edition.
	But mplayer is the better choice.

	## refere to (plug-in-gap-mplayer-decode.txt) ##
	## refere to (plug-in-gap-xanim-decode.txt) ##

	The other methode can read the frames from one or more
	videofiles and pass them to one of the GIMP-GAP video encoders
	without the need to store the frames separately.
	This methode requires a storyboard file.
	The storyboard file describes
	how to assemble videoclips, images and audiofiles
	to one resulting output video.

Output to videofile:

        GIMP-GAP provides video encoder plug-ins
        to save a series of input frame images or videoclips
        as videofile.
        This process is called encoding and usually 
        does compresses the processed frames and audiodata.

        GIMP-GAP encoder plug-ins can operate on
        a series of numbered frame images or storyboard files
        as input (encoding on the fly).
        	
	Another option is to convert the frames to one multilayerd image
	that can be saved as MNG animation, animated-GIF
	(or, in the future in other animation formats 
	when other load/save modules were added to the GIMP)

	GIMP-GAP provides automated fileformat conversions for
	the frames of an animation. 
	This conversions offer a way to use external
	video encoder programs.
	All GIMP-supported imagefileformats may be used.
	
	On UNIX Platforms GIMP-GAP provides frontend dialog interfaces for
	external software MPEG video encoder programs.
	(mpeg_encode and mpeg2encode)
	This methode and both encoders are old.
	External encoders can NOT directly encode storyboard files,
	and typically want input as series of single frames in PPM format.
	This need much diskspace and extra time for converting
	frames to PPM.

	## refere to (plug-in-gap-mpeg2encode.txt) ##

The Storyboard:
        Storyboards are useful for the creation and cutting of longer videos.
        GIMP-GAP provides the storyboard dialog to create and edit
        simple storyboard files.
        Storyboard files are textfiles and can be compared with playlists
        for videoclips, images and audioclips.
        
        In this release the storyboard dialog is limited to simple storyboard
        features without soundsupport. 
        For encoding videos via storyboard files the soundsupport is
        already implemented and there are some more features available.
        
        See docs/reference/txt/STORYBOARD_FILE_DOC.txt 
	for the complete Syntax description.
        

Morphing:
        Morphing can be used to render frames
        between 2 scenes.
        ** Morphing is  still an experimental feature and not fully documented yet **

Onionskin Layers
        GIMP-GAP does support onionskin layers.

How to use
--------------------------------------------------------------------


- Creating multiple frames (video frames)
- ---------------------------------------

   - from an existing single image
	Save your image as XCF file.  (<Image>/File/Save as)
	use a name that ends up in _000001.xcf (or _000001.xcfgz)

	Then duplicate your image (<Image>/Video/Duplicate)
	You'll be asked how much copies you need.
	(Note: all copies are stored on disk immediate
               without explicite save)

    - from an existing layeranimated multilayer image
	use
            <Image>/Video/Split Img to frames

	This will create frames, a series of images on disk,
	with a name that ends up in _000001.xcf).
	Optional you may use other extensions. (.xcfgz, .jpg ...)

	WARNING: The extension defines the fileformat
                 of the frames. Most of the other formats
                 (than GIMP's .xcf format) can not save
                 multilayer frames, or frames with alpha channels.

   - from outside the GIMP
	You may rename and copy existing XCF images
	according to the frame naming conventions.
	<img>_000001.xcf
	<img>_000002.xcf
	...
	Then load (only one of them) into the GIMP.


- Navigation (Goto)
- ------------------
      It is recommanded to define some accelerator keys for quick
      walk through the frames.
      Here are my settings (excerpt from my $HOME/.gimp/menurc )

      (menu-path "<Image>/Video/Goto/First Frame" "<control><alt>1")
      (menu-path "<Image>/Video/Goto/Prev Frame" "<alt>1")
      (menu-path "<Image>/Video/Goto/Next Frame" "<alt>2")
      (menu-path "<Image>/Video/Goto/Any Frame" "<alt>3")
      (menu-path "<Image>/Video/Goto/Last Frame" "<control><alt>2")
      
      Alternatives:
      - You may open the GIMP-GAP videoplayer
        (menu-path: <Image>/Video/Playback...)
        and use the player for visual positioning 
        (use the FrameNr Button or the GO-Button array for that task)
      
      - You may open the GIMP-GAP video navigator dialog
        (menu-path: <Image>/Video/VCR Navigator)


- Main render features
----------------------

 GIMP-GAP provides features for rendering moving objects
 and for automated modifying of multilple frames.

 ## refere to (plug-in-gap-move-path.txt) ##
 ## refere to (plug-in-gap-modify.txt) ##

      
      
- NO UNDO:
- --------
  There is no Undo for the video frame based GIMP-GAP video plug-ins.
  If you step to the next frame (menu: <image>/Video/Goto Next)
  the current frame is saved to disk and the next frame
  is loaded into the image. 
  All undo steps were cleared at this time.


- About Locks
- -----------

   All the GIMP-GAP plug-ins are using a lock.
   This lock disables to run other GIMP-GAP plug-ins (or the same plug-in twice)
   on the same image at the same time,
   while the current GIMP-GAP plug-in is working on that frame.
   
   GIMP-GAP keeps a locktable (for the current session) that contains
   the image_id's of all images currently locked by GIMP-GAP plug-ins.

   If you cancel a running GIMP-GAP plug-in with the cancel button
   in the progress window,
   or kill it from your operating sytem the lock may remain.
   (This should only happen to WINDOWS users, for UNIX users
    locks are checked for dead process ids)

   To unlock you can save the current frame image,
   close all views to that image, then reload the frame image.
   (or quit and restart the GIMP)

  WARNING:
  It is not recommanded to open more than one frame of
  an animation at the same time.
  (menu: File/Open "img_000001.xcf"
   menu: File/Open "img_000002.xcf")
  
  In this constellation both gap plug-ins may concurrent 
  in save/load to/from the same file.
  Example:
     call from "img_000001.xcf" Video/Delete Frames (range 000001 to 000003)
           now img_000004.xcf is renamed to img_000001.xcf
               img_000005.xcf is renamed to img_000002.xcf
 
     then  
     call from "img_000002.xcf" Video/Goto First
            the img_000002.xcf (its old content) is saved,
                             overwiting wht was img_000004.xcf before.
  If you make the 2.nd call while the 1.st one is in progress,
  you may trash your frames (2 writers on one file) and/or crash
  your GIMP session.
