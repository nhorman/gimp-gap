Foreground Extract Filter

    Start from Menu:
       <Image>/Layer/Transparency/Foreground Extract
       ## <Image>/Video/Layer/Attributes/Foreground Extract  ##

How to use:
  
   Have a image with a forground object loaded in GIMP
     (for instance a person) that shall be
     separated from the background.
     The image shall be of RGB color

   Add a layermask to the layer that shall be processed
     and fill the layermask whith a medium Gray color
     now the complete layer looks semi-transparent.
     
   Paint on the layermask with WHITE color to mark foreground areas.
     the painted areas appear fully opaque.
   
   Paint on the layermask with BLACK color to mark backround areas.
     the painted areas disappear, e.g get fully transparent.
     
   Take care that you DO NOT mark background areas as foreground 
     and vice versa. (e.g. your brush strokes
     shall not overlap the borders of the forground object.
     
   When finished with that (rough) selection call the 
   Foreground Extract Filter
      select "Layermask" in the TRI.MAP combo box
      
      use unchecked state for the checkbuttons 
      Create Layermask and Lock Colors
      
      This will create a new layer as copy of your input layer
      with calculated transparency for the UNDEFINED areas.
      This copy is placed above your input layer.
      
   Set your original layer invisible
     to check the result.
     (click the Eye-Icon in the GIMP Layers dialog
      to toggle visibility)
     
   
   
   Note that the quality of the result depends on the provided TRI-MAP.
   In many cases you can improve the results by tuning the TRI-MAP
   on those areas where the filter algorithm did not deliver acceptable results
   and run the filter again.
   
   For good results approximately 70% of the area shall be marked
   as either FORGROUND or BACKGROUND. Further note that processing time
   depends on the size of the UNDEFINED areas.
   
   
Options:

   Create Layermask
      ON:  Render opacity by creating a new layer mask for the resulting layer
      OFF: Apply rendered opacity to the alpha channel

   Lock Colors
      ON:  Keep RGB channels of the input layer
      OFF: Allow Background color removal in processed undefined regions


How it Works:
       
    The foreground extract filter calculates opacity and color based on a TRI-MAP.
    The TRI-MAP is a special kind of user selection where the user marks areas as FOREGROUND (white)
    BACKGROUND (black) and UNDEFINED (gray). The filter can calculate opacity and modify color for the
    UNDEFINED areas in the corresponding layer.
    Typically a layermask will be used as TRI-MAP. 
    Optionally you may select another layer (with same size) as TRI-MAP input.
    Note that RGB TR-MAP input is implicite converted to GRAYSCALE representation
    where values >= 240 are considered as FOREGROUND, value 0 marks BACKGROUND and all other
    values are considered as UNDEFINED.
    
    In case the processed layer already has an alpha channel, fully transparent
    areas are also marked as BACKGROUND. (e.g. fully transparent pixels keep their transparency
    and overrule the value in the corresponding TRI-MAP pixel
    (even if the TRI-MAP marks those pixels as foreground)

    
    The foreground extraction is based on the alpha matting algorithm.

  Whats the difference to the foreground extraction tool?
   The old algorithm, implemented after an older paper (http://www.siox.org/), 
   has the main problem that it generates only a binary alpha matte. 
   The problems with that is that you can have severe "color bleeding" of the background color 
   into the foreground at borders. For example, fine black hair on a green background gets darkish green. 
   Also, you don't have any transparancy or antialiasing at borders, each pixel is either foreground or background.

   The new algorithm, on the other hand, tries to find out the foreground AND the background color of each pixel, 
   and with that, it can calculate a semitransparent alpha value. 
   This also means that the background color can be removed from the final extracted pixel, 
   what gives, in general, much better results.
