Delete Frames

    Start from Menu:
        <Image>/Video/Delete Frames

    This feature deletes frames.
    this is done starting at the current frame number
    (inclusive) until the specified frame number (inclusive).

    The current frame number is shown in the headline
    text "Delete frames from <current framenr> to (number)

    There is no undo for this operation, so please use
    it with care.
    
    Notes: 
      Normally there is a confirmation dialog before
      the frames are deleted.
      
      The confirmation dialog is configuration dependent
      and can be supressed by adding this configuration
      parameter to your gimprc file:

      # the video-confirm-frame-delete can have values "yes" or "no"
      # where "no" does not show the confirm dialog windows when the user
      # tries to delete video frames of the video.
      # (default is "yes")
      (video-confirm-frame-delete "no")
