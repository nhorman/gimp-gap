Make Duplicates of Frame Range

    Start from Menu:
        <Image>/Video/Duplicate Frames

    
    This feature duplicates the specified range of frames
    N-times.
    The duplicated frames are inserted after the current
    frame (the frame from where this plug-in was invoked)
    
    When this plug-in is started, the settings 
    "From Frame", "To Frame" and "N times"
    are initialized in a way that it will duplicate
    the current frame once.

Example:
    when the current frame is 2 out of 5 frames
    and we apply the settings:
      From Farem: 2
      To Frame:   4
      N times:    2
    
    As result 6 frames will be inserted after frame 2.
    The inserted frame sequence is made as copy of
    the frames (referring to the old frame numbers):

      pic_000001.xcf
      pic_000002.xcf
      
      /* the newly inserted frames */
      pic_000003.xcf   (copy of old pic_000002.xcf)
      pic_000004.xcf   (copy of old pic_000003.xcf)
      pic_000005.xcf   (copy of old pic_000004.xcf)
      pic_000006.xcf   (copy of old pic_000002.xcf)
      pic_000007.xcf   (copy of old pic_000003.xcf)
      pic_000008.xcf   (copy of old pic_000004.xcf)

      /* the renamed remaining frames */
      pic_000009.xcf   (renamed src was frame number 3)
      pic_000010.xcf   (renamed src was frame number 4)
      pic_000011.xcf   (renamed src was frame number 5)
